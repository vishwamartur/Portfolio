# ReactJS Portfolio Readme

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website built using ReactJS.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reactjs-portfolio.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd reactjs-portfolio
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the website in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

To build the production-ready version of the website:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the website in the `build` directory.

## Customization

You can customize the content and styling of the portfolio website by editing the files in the `src` directory. Feel free to modify the components, styles, and content to suit your needs.

## Deployment

Once you have customized your portfolio website and built the production-ready version, you can deploy it to a hosting service of your choice. Simply upload the contents of the `build` directory to your hosting server.
